Hugo is an awesome way to create a simple static website, so blogs and personal webpages. EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud is a web service that allows developers to rent virtual computers and run their applications in the cloud. Route53 is a cloud DNS (Domain Name System) from AWS. Nginx is the webserver that we are going to use on our EC2 instance to serve our Hugo site. Let's encrypt is the certificate authority we are going to use.
