[**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/) is an awesome way to create a simple static website, so blogs and personal webpages.

[**EC2**](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) - Elastic Compute Cloud is a web service that allows developers to rent virtual computers and run their applications in the cloud.

[**Route53**](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) is a cloud DNS (Domain Name System) from AWS.

[**Nginx**](https://www.nginx.com/) is the webserver that we are going to use on our EC2 instance to serve our Hugo site.

[**Let's encrypt**](https://letsencrypt.org/) is the certificate authority we are going to use. Main reason being that it is super easy to use thanks to certbot and it is free.

If you already own a domain everything we are going to do is going to be free of charge thanks to the AWS free tier.
